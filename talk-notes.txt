Why did you choose the name “Y Combinator?”
The Y combinator is one of the coolest ideas in computer science. It's also a
metaphor for what we do. It's a program that runs programs; we're a company
that helps start companies.

--- New ideas for H&P version of this talk ---

Family tree of languages, understanding the ancestor

Lambda -> Tromp Lambda -> Church -> Turing -> Church-Turing thesis

Lambda Cal is minimal yet allows elegant programs
(as compared to Turing machines, abstraction is key, functions are composable)

Algebraic data type in LC

Proposition as types, relation to logic
(aliens would know about LC)

At the end, related back to familiar languages
