Dr Melvin Zhang will present his "Introduction to Lambda Calculus". As some of
you know Functional Programming languages have been around a long time,
however they are all based upon something much older, Lambda Calculus. Melvin
will show how powerful Church's Lambda Calculus is and how it directly relates
to Functional languages. this is a great basis from which to understand how to
use Languages such as Clojure.
