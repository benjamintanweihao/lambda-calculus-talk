Functional Programming from First Principles

Many recent programming languages, such as Javascript, Ruby, and Scala,
include elements of functional programming. These languages are large and
complicated, which makes it difficult to grasp the essence of functional
programming.

Church's Lambda Calculus is the oldest and simplest possible functional
programming language. It has the following syntax:
<var> ::= a | b | ... | z
<exp> ::= <var> | (\<var> <exp>) | (<exp> <exp>)

In this talk, we will illustrate the principles of functional programming
using Church's Lambda Calculus via a series of demos based on
